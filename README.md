# AutoVCL: Self-Balancing Enhancement for Variational Continual Learning

## Overview

This repository hosts the "AutoVCL: Self-Balancing Enhancement for Variational Continual Learning" project, a detailed assignment from the "Uncertainty in Deep Learning" course at the University of Oxford. The project builds upon the core concepts of **Variational Continual Learning**, aiming to refine and advance the methodology.

## Results

The root directory contains notebooks designed to reproduce the relavent original VCL results and to facilitate further exploration of a self-balancing Variational Continual Learning framework. If the images are not properly rendered in the notebooks, please refer to the two PDF documents located in `results/pdf`.
